# Ability helper examples

This is a storybook project that contains examples of scenarios that the ability-helpers library can support. Also serves as a development workbench.

Currently all examples are in react, following the older `demo`  package, but in the future standard HTML and vanilla js examples are envisionedp

### Usage

`yarn start` will run the storybook

`yarn start:production` will use the built version of `ability-helpers` in the repo

`yarn build` will build the storybook as a static website
